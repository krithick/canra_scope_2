When he receives the draft, the officer on duty, Ms. Kavita, informs him of the applicable service charges. Mr. Suresh becomes visibly upset and claims that he was informed earlier that no charges would apply for the draft. The argument becomes heated, attracting the attention of other customers and staff. As the Branch Manager, you observe the situation and must intervene to resolve the conflict."
